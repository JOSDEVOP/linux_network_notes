1. [ip link] is use to list all interfaces whether virtual or physical
2. [ip addr or ip -c a] list the ip address of the interface
3.for two or more computers to communicate on the same network we need a switch which is a smart device that enables  the computerst to talk to each other
4.for two networks to communicate we need a router for the the devices on  those networks to be able to communicate.For any network to be able be able to communicate they both need to have a default gateway which acts the door to that to that network. we can use the command ip route add ip address of the network we can to communicate via the default gateway of the other network. example is ip route add 216.134.45.0/24 via 192.168.2.1 or if we dont know the ip address of the network whose device we want to use to communicate to another device tthen we simply write ip route add default via default gateway ip address
4.[resolvectl status] brings up the all network  interfaces that is currently used been used and it also brings all information of resolved dns of that system
4.[sudo vi /etc/systemd/resolve.conf] we can make changes to the global dns resolution on our system over here and for changes to happen [sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolve]
5.[resolvectl dns] brings up the information of the current nework interface been used and its dns .
6.[ sudo netplan get ] brings the all the information about the network configuration and the interface been used.
7.[sudo cat /etc/netplan/99-mycustomsettings.yaml] can be used to create one own network configuration.[man netplan] /whatever we are looking for and to copy setup from there and put in our configuration or we can copy it from. after making the custom changes to ur network netplan [sudo netplan try or sudo netplan apply] needs to be apply for change to take place,after that we can run [systemctl daemon-reload].
8.[sudo  systemctl ]
